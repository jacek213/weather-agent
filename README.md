# Weather Notification Agent

This is a simple Python agent that fetches weather data from an API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap) and notifies the user about the weather conditions.

## Features
- Fetches current weather data for a specified city
- Notifies the user via terminal output (can be extended to desktop notifications or email)

## Setup
1. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. Get a free API key from [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api).
3. Set your API key and city in the `main.py` file.

## Usage
Run the agent:
```sh
python main.py
```

Or run via a copilot task:
```sh
⇧⌘B # and than select the task
```

Feel free to extend this agent with more features, such as scheduled notifications or different notification channels!
